abstract: 'For portability, embedded systems software follows a layered design to reduce dependence on particular hardware behavior. We consider the problem of identifying layering violations: instances where the embedded application accesses non-adjacent layers. This paper presents our preliminary work to detect a class of layering violations called *Non Conventional MMIO Accesses (NCMAs)*. We find them by searching for direct Memory Mapped Input Output (MMIO) accesses made outside of the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). For evaluation, we curated a list of 988 applications spanning 5 Real Time Operating Systems (RTOSes) -- *the first large dataset of compilable embedded applications*. Our system identified 369 NCMAs. We reported these issues to the corresponding developers and found interesting reasons for committing layering violations. We have open-sourced our tool and the collected dataset to foster future research.'
